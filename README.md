# direct-policy

The DirectProject policy engine is an optional runtime module that enables enforcement of X509 certificate policy. The primary use case of the engine is within the security and trust agent to “filter” certificates at specific points in the agent’s process. Because of the module and independent design of the engine, it can be utilized outside the agent where use cases exist to consume the engine in such a manner.
